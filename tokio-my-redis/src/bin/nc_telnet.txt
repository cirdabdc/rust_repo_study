Quick Test Commands:
Option 1: Using nc (netcat) - Recommended
nc localhost 6666
Then type any text and press Enter - it should echo back to you.
Option 2: Using curl
curl telnet://localhost:6666
Option 3: Test from another terminal with Rust
I can help you create a simple test client if needed.
To use your echo server:
First, make sure your echo server is running:
cargo run --bin echo-server-copy
In another terminal, connect with:
nc localhost 6666
Type something and press Enter - you should see it echoed back!
